# AdHavocBinaryTree
Javascript library for drawing nice binary trees

I found that I needed to display a binary tree nicely and didn't like the options out there. I came up with an algorithm to display them, but I also wanted to tell others how I did it. And I wanted it to look nice too. So I added some animation in as well.
